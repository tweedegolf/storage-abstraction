## MinIO Adapter

This adapter provides an abstraction layer over the API of the MinIO cloud storage service. Although it can be use stand-alone it is actually meant as a peer dependency of the Storage Abstraction package, see the [readme](This https://github.com/tweedegolf/storage-abstraction/blob/master/README.md)
