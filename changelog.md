# 1.4.7 - 1.5.2

- Added support for Azure &rarr; all credits: [tesirm99](https://github.com/tesirm99)
- Upgrade all packages
- Fixed numerous async errors
- AdapterAmazonS3: use `s3-request-presigner` to create links to objects
- AdapterAmazonS3: added support for S3 compatible storages (tested with Cloudflare R2 and Backblaze S3)
- AdapterLocal now treats values without prefix passed to `mode` as decimal number instead of octal numbers
- AdapterLocal: if you pass the config as an object and you don't provide a value for `bucketName`, the bucketName will no longer be set to the last folder of the value you provide for `directory`. In other words: if you want to set a value for `bucketName` you have to add it specifically to the config object.

# 1.4.5

- Remove option 'slug' in config: this makes the user responsible for choosing a valid bucket name.
- Add `options` to `createBucket`.
- Add `options` to `addFileFromPath`, `addFileFromBuffer` and `addFileFromReadable`.
- Add `skipCheck` to configuration object and made all keys optional
- Return public url after a file has been successfully added to a bucket

# 1.4.4

- use '@aws-sdk/client-s3' instead of 'aws-sdk'
- eslint fixes

# 1.4.3

- Removed `await-to-js` dependency in local storage adapter

# 1.4.2

- Added `ConfigAmazonS3`, `ConfigBackblazeB2`, `ConfigGoogleCloud` and `ConfigLocal` to exported types
- Removed `await-to-js` dependency

# 1.4.1

- Added `AdapterConfig` to exported types

# 1.4.0

- Changed the name of the 'functional classes' from Storage to Adapter, e.g. `StorageAmazonS3` became `AdapterAmazonS3`
- Replaced `introspect()` by `getConfiguration():AdapterConfig` and `getType():string`
- Added adapter class for BackBlaze B2
- Made configuration more generic and extensible
- Removed option to create a new Storage without configuration (StorageLocal)
- Added default storage options that can be overruled or extended by the config object or url
- Made slugify optional and turned it off by default for StorageLocal
- Added API method `fileExists():Promise<boolean>`
- In the configuration object or string non-existent keys or invalid values are no longer filtered out: it is the programmer's responsibility to provide valid options
- If no bucket name is provided the bucket name will always be an empty string "", not `undefined` or `null`. Also when no bucket is selected `bucketName` will be "".
- Adapter modules are only loaded when needed (using `require`)
- Removed options from both configuration and adapters.
- Formalized return values

# 1.3.1

- Removed sloppy code: parsing and validation of configuration is now done in one [place](https://github.com/tweedegolf/storage-abstraction/blob/master/src/util.ts).
- Removed jasmine-ts dependency

# 1.3.0

- Removed `getFileByteRangeAsReadable` and merged the functionality in `getFileAsReadable` by adding a range parameter `{start: number, end: number}`
- Removed the option to instantiate a specific storage type directly; all instantiating must be done with `new Storage(config)`.
- Optimized `getFileAsReadable` for Google Cloud.
- Implemented `addFileFromReadable`, fixes [issue#2](https://github.com/tweedegolf/storage-abstraction/issues/2)
- Added configuration urls: all configuration options in a single string.
- When creating a local storage without specifying a directory, the directory where the process runs will be used (in earlier versions the os' tmp folder was used)
- When creating a local storage without specifying a bucket name, a directory named `local-bucket` will be created and used as selected bucket.
- When using `new Storage()` without configuration you create a local storage instance with the default configuration (as described in the 2 bullets above).
- Updated documentation.
- Updated dependency version.
- Added yarn.lock.
- Renamed 'functional classes' to 'adapter classes'
